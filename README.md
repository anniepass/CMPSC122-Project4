# Project 4

This assignment is an optimization/resource allocation problem.  It requires an algorithm that will produce the best statistics for an airport with two runways, provided all details about scheduled arrivals and departure.  Statistics such as the number of planes crashed and average wait time need to be optimized.  In cases where we cannot ensure zero negative statistics, the program will prioritze certain planes over others, based on the number of passengers and the amount of cargo aboard.
